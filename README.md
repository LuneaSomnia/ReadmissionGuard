ReadmissionGuard is a sophisticated healthcare application designed to reduce hospital readmission rates by leveraging advanced AI and knowledge graph technologies. The primary goal is to help healthcare providers identify patients at high risk of readmission and implement targeted interventions before they require rehospitalization. The implementation focuses on three key components working in harmony through the Modus framework. The application processes patient data including medical history, current conditions, medications, and previous hospital visits to generate comprehensive risk assessments and personalized intervention recommendations. The Modus API framework serves as the foundational development environment and orchestration layer for ReadmissionGuard. Through modus.json, I have defined the project's core architecture, including the AI model specifications, data connections, and API endpoints. The modus framework handles the heavy lifting of integrating these components, allowing me to focus on building the application logic while managing the communication between different components. For AI capabilities, ReadmissionGuard utilizes GPT-4 through the Modus AI integration. This classification model analyzes patient data patterns to predict readmission risks. Through the Modus framework's PredictReadmissionRisk function, the model processes multiple factors including age, previous admissions, chronic conditions, and current medications to generate risk scores. These predictions help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take preventive actions, all without managing the complex AI infrastructure directly. The knowledge graph implementation using Dgraph creates a sophisticated network of patient data relationships. This graph structure maps complex connections between patients, their medical histories, treatments, and outcomes. Through Dgraph queries, we can traverse these relationships to understand patterns in readmissions, track intervention effectiveness, and identify high-risk patients. The knowledge graph stores not just individual data points, but the relationships between them, enabling deeper insights into patient care patterns and quick identification of similar patient cases and their successful intervention strategies. The Modus framework ties these components together by providing a unified interface for data flow. When a patient's data is processed, it flows through the knowledge graph for context enrichment, then through the AI model for risk assessment, and finally back to the application for intervention recommendations. This integrated approach creates a powerful system that learns and improves over time as more data is processed. ReadmissionGuard provides several key functionalities:

1. Real-time risk assessment for patients.
2. Personalized intervention recommendations.
3. Historical pattern analysis.
4. Treatment effectiveness tracking.
5. Patient progress monitoring.
6. Data-driven decision support for healthcare providers.

The frontend, built with AssemblyScript, communicates with these backend components through the Modus API endpoints, creating a seamless user experience for healthcare providers while maintaining the complex data processing and AI operations behind the scenes. Healthcare providers can access this information through an intuitive interface, enabling them to make informed decisions about patient care and intervention strategies. The system continuously learns from new data, improving its predictions and recommendations over time. The combination of AI predictions, knowledge graph insights, and real-time monitoring creates a powerful tool for reducing hospital readmissions and improving patient outcomes. This architecture ensures that ReadmissionGuard delivers accurate, timely insights while remaining scalable and maintainable.
